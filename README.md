# Tough Glass

Adds a new block, Tough Glass which has the following differences from regular glass:

* Requires a diamond or better pickaxe to mine
* Has the same blast resistance as obsidian
* Has a hardness of 10; much higher than glass but not as high as obsidian
* Cannot be moved by pistons or slime blocks
* Is always dropped when broken; no Silk Touch necessary
